Description: Rapid fuzzy string matching library
 RapidFuzz is a fast string matching library for Python and C++,
 providing Levenshtein and other distances.  This is similar to the
 functionality of the python3-fuzzywuzzy package.  There are a few
 significant differences between these packages:
 .
 1) RapidFuzz is MIT licensed.
 2) RapidFuzz provides many string metrics, such as Hamming and Jaro-Winkler,
    which are not included in FuzzyWuzzy.
 3) RapidFuzz is mostly written in C++, and has further algorithmic
    improvements to make string matching even faster.
 4) RapidFuzz fixes multiple bugs in the `partial_ratio` implementation.
